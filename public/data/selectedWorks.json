				"For this fictional project, I reached out to designer Maria Sheveleva via Behance with the aim of bringing her redesign proposal to life for the Gaggenau website. This company is renowned for its expertise in luxury kitchen appliances. Due to time constraints, I was able to create only the homepage of the website. Nonetheless, this experience enabled me to enhance my programming skills while directly collaborating with a designer."

This approach allows me, on one hand, to continuously push the boundaries of my utilization of this technology that I hold in high regard. On the other hand, it provides me with the opportunity to showcase a glimpse of my skills in the field of 3D on the web."
